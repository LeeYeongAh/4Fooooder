Traditionally, the English Canadian tart consists of butter, sugar, and eggs in a pastry shell, similar to the French-Canadian sugar pie, or the base of the U.S. pecan pie without the nut topping. The butter tart is different from the sugar pie given the lack of flour in the filling. The butter tart is different from pecan pie in that it has a "runnier" filling due to the omission of corn starch.

Borscht derives from an ancient soup originally cooked from pickled stems, leaves and umbels of common hogweed (Heracleum sphondylium), a herbaceous plant growing in damp meadows, which lent the dish its Slavic name. With time, it evolved into a diverse array of tart soups, among which the beet-based red borscht has become the most popular.

Traditionally, the definition of stromming is "herring fished in the brackish waters of the Baltic north of the Kalmar Strait". The herring used for surstromming are caught just prior to spawning in April and May. During the production of surströmming, just enough salt is used to prevent the raw herring from rotting while allowing it to ferment. A fermentation process of at least six months gives the fish its characteristic strong smell and somewhat acidic taste. According to a Japanese study, a newly opened can of surstromming has one of the most putrid food smells in the world, even stronger than similarly fermented fish dishes such as the Korean hongeohoe or Japanese kusaya. At the end of the 1940s, surstromming producers in Sweden lobbied for a royal ordinance (Swedish: forordning) that would prevent incompletely fermented fish from being sold. The decree that was issued forbade sales of the current year's production in Sweden prior to the third Thursday in August. While the ordinance is no longer on the books, retailers still maintain the date for the "premiere" of that year's catch.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Surstr%C3%B6mming.jpg/330px-Surstr%C3%B6mming.jpg,,"MY: {}, //Malaysia"

Therefore it is generally regarded as a cheese. The texture is firm, but slightly softer than Gouda cheese, for example, and lends itself well to cutting and shaping. It does not crumble like hard cheeses. The taste is sweet, and best described as caramel-like, but with a tang that is more noticeable in the variants that contain goat's milk.

This later version is also common in Spain and very similar to the New Orleans king cake. Tradition holds that the cake is "to draw the kings" to the Epiphany. A figurine, la feve, which can represent anything from a car to a cartoon character, is hidden in the cake, and the person who finds the trinket in his or her slice becomes king for the day and will have to offer the next cake. Originally, la feve was literally a broad bean, but it was replaced in 1870 by a variety of figurines made out of porcelain or more recently plastic. These figurines have become popular collectibles and can often be bought separately. Individual bakeries may offer a specialized line of fèves depicting diverse themes from great works of art to classic movie stars and popular cartoon characters. The cakes are usually sold in special bags, some of which can be used to heat the cake in a microwave oven without ruining the crispness of the cake. A paper crown is included with the cake to crown the "king" who finds the feve in their piece of cake. To ensure a random distribution of the cake shares, it is traditional for the youngest person to place themselves under the table and name the recipient of the share which is indicated by the person in charge of the service.

In modern times, pretzels come in a wide range of shapes. Salt is the most common seasoning for pretzels, complementing the washing soda or lye treatment that gives pretzels their traditional skin and flavor acquired through the Maillard reaction. Other seasonings are cheeses, sugar, chocolate, cinnamon, sweet glazing, seeds, and nuts. Varieties of pretzels include soft pretzels, which should be eaten shortly after preparation, and hard-baked pretzels, which have a long shelf life.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/BrezelnSalz02_%28cropped%29.JPG/375px-BrezelnSalz02_%28cropped%29.JPG,,
77,"Western Europe",DE,Germany,Schweinshaxe,"Schweinshaxe , in German cuisine, is a roasted ham hock. The ham hock is the end of the pig's leg, just above the ankle and below the meaty ham portion. It is especially popular in Bavaria as Schweinshaxn or Sauhax. A variation of this dish is known in parts of Germany as Eisbein, in which the ham hock is pickled and usually slightly boiled. Schweinshaxe is one of the formerly typical peasant foods, in which recipes were composed to make inexpensive and tough cuts of meat more palatable (see, for beef, the popular Sauerbraten). Such inexpensive cuts usually require long periods of preparation. The meat is sometimes marinated for days, and in the case of big cuts up to a week. The Schweinshaxe is then roasted at low temperatures, typically depending on size for two to three hours. The most popular side dishes are potatoes and cabbage variations. The Austrian version of this dish is called Stelze or in dialect Stötzn/Stelzn. It is usually marinated or pre-boiled in a caraway seed and garlic brine, roasted until the skin is crisp, and served with mustard, horseradish, and pickled chili peppers. The Bavarian version is classically served with potato dumplings and red cabbage, or with sauerkraut and potatoes.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Schweinshaxe_Chiang_Mai.JPG/401px-Schweinshaxe_Chiang_Mai.JPG,,

97,"Southern Europe",GR,Greece,"Greek yogurt","Strained yogurt, Greek yogurt, yogurt cheese, or sack yoghurt is yogurt that has been strained to remove most of its whey, resulting in a thicker consistency than unstrained yogurt, while preserving yogurt's distinctive sour taste. Like many types of yogurt, strained yogurt is often made from milk that has been enriched by boiling off some of its water content, or by adding extra butterfat and powdered milk. In Europe and North America, it is often made from low-fat or fat-free milk. In Iceland, a similar product named skyr is made. Strained yogurt is generally marketed in North America as "Greek yogurt" and in Britain as "Greek-style yoghurt",though strained yogurt is also widely eaten in Levantine, Eastern Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, Central Asian and South Asian cuisines, wherein it is often used in cooking (as it is high enough in fat content to avoid curdling at higher temperatures). Such dishes may be cooked or raw, savoury or sweet. Due to the straining process to remove excess whey, even non-fat varieties of strained yogurt are much thicker, richer, and creamier than yogurts that have not been strained. Since the straining process removes the whey, or fluid, from the milk solids, it requires substantially more plain yogurt to produce a cup of strained yogurt, so the cost to make it is increased accordingly. Thickeners, such as pectin, locust bean gum, starches or guar gum, listed in the ingredients indicate straining was not the method used to consolidate the milk solids. Marketing of Greek or Greek-style yogurt in the United States allows the use of more thickeners instead of straining, so there is little difference between the yogurt of years prior to the introduction of strained yogurt other than an increase of thickeners, even though the price is now higher for the original, unstrained products. In western Europe and the US, strained yogurt has increased in popularity compared to unstrained yogurt. Since the straining process removes some of the lactose, strained yogurt is lower in sugar than unstrained yogurt.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Labneh01.jpg/375px-Labneh01.jpg,,

Casabe baking in a small commercial bakery
To make casabe, the starchy root of bitter cassava is ground to a pulp, then squeezed to expel a milky, bitter liquid called yare. This carries the poisonous substances with it out of the pulp. Traditionally, this squeezing is done in a sebucan, an 8 to 12-foot (3.7 m) long, tube-shaped, pressure strainer, woven in a characteristic helical pattern from palm leaves. The sebucan usually is hung from a tree branch or ceiling pole, and it has a closed bottom with a loop that is attached to a fixed stick or lever, which is used to stretch the sebucan.

It is popular across the Levant, but especially in Jordan on account of its easy preparation and cheap ingredients. To make the dish, the olive oil is heated in a large frying pan. The onions and peppers are diced and the tomatoes are cubed and optionally peeled. The onions are then added and cooked until translucent, at which point the rest of the ingredients are added and the mixture is sautéed until it is thick but not dry. Galayet bandora is usually eaten with warm pita bread, which is used to scoop it up, though galayet bandora can also be served over rice and eaten with utensils. When served in a restaurant or at a formal event, it is often garnished with toasted pine nuts. Many varieties of the dish exist, including ones with meat (ground beef or beef or lamb stew meat), fried eggs or garlic. It is believed to originate in the Ghor al-Safi and Ghor al Mazraa, the rural regions surrounding the Dead Sea that make up the "breadbasket" of Jordan. The hot climate in these regions of the Jordan Valley is ideal for growing tomatoes. Because it is an easy one-pot meal, galayet bandora is often eaten while camping or backpacking.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/%D9%82%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A9_%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A9.jpg/375px-%D9%82%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A9_%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A9.jpg,,

Curry dishes prepared in the southern states of India, where the word also originated, may be spiced with leaves from the curry tree. There are many varieties of dishes called 'curries'. For example, in original traditional cuisines, the precise selection of spices for each dish is a matter of national or regional cultural tradition, religious practice, and, to some extent, family preference. Such dishes are called by specific names that refer to their ingredients, spicing, and cooking methods. Spices are used both whole and ground, cooked or raw, and they may be added at different times during the cooking process to produce different results. The main spices found in most curry powders of the Indian subcontinent are coriander, cumin, and turmeric. A wide range of additional spices may be included depending on the geographic region and the foods being included (fish, lentils, red or white meat, rice, and vegetables). Curry powder, a commercially prepared mixture of spices, is largely a Western creation, dating to the 18th century. Such mixtures are commonly thought to have first been prepared by Indian merchants for sale to members of the British Colonial
government and army returning to Britain. Outside of the Indian subcontinent, "curry" may also be used to describe the various unrelated native dishes of Island Southeast Asia, Mainland Southeast Asia, and Oceania which use coconut milk or spice pastes and are commonly eaten over rice (like the Filipino ginataan and Thai gaeng class of dishes). Dishes called 'curry' may contain fish, meat, poultry, or shellfish, either alone or in combination with vegetables. Additionally, many instead are entirely vegetarian, eaten especially among those who hold ethical or religious proscriptions against eating meat or seafood. Curries may be either 'dry' or 'wet'. Dry curries are cooked with very little liquid which is allowed to evaporate, leaving the other ingredients coated with the spice mixture.

It is easy to access because maize and beans are readily available in these areas since they are mostly sourced directly from local farms and homesteads.

Githiri can also be made into a stew with the addition of vegetables and potatoes, and sometimes meat. Githeri is also used to make mukimo after the addition of potatoes, bananas, and greens, and mashing up the mixture. Lately there has been a rise in the popularity of githeri due to the health benefits associated with the plant-based dish.

The same dish based comprising 2 key ingredients of maize and beans other available legumes and even ground nuts is know by other names and as a traditional dish from at least as far north of Africa as Ethiopia right down to South Africa. Kande, Pure, Ngate are some of the names it goes by in different parts of Tanzania for example. The dish has quite a much bigger footprint than just Kenya and the Gikuyu tribe.

Part of the popularity of this dish arises because it has been the main meal served to students since the 1920s. Eating githeri has also become trendy with young people. Many hotels in Kenya serve githeri.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Githeri.jpg/330px-Githeri.jpg,,

Moin-Moin is prepared by first soaking the beans in cold water until they are soft enough to remove the fine outer covering or peel. Then they are ground or blended (using a blender) until a fine paste is achieved. Salt, bouillon cube, dried crayfish, vegetable oil (or any edible oil such as palm oil) and other seasonings are added to taste. Some add sardines, corned beef, sliced boiled eggs, or a combination of these and other 'garnishes' to liven up Moin-Moin. Such is referred to as having 'x' number of lives, 'x' representing the number of garnishes added. The most touted is Moin-Moin elemi meje, which translates to Moin-Moin with seven lives.

Moin-Moin usually comes in a slanted pyramid shape or a cylindrical shape, owing to the mold it is poured into prior to cooking. The pyramid shape comes from the traditional broad "ewe eran" (Thaumatococcus daniellii) or banana leaves fashioned into a cone in one's palm, then the seasoned and garnished liquid is poured into the leaves, which is then folded.

The cylindrical shapes come from empty cans of milk or tomato sauce used in preparation of other dishes. Once placed in its mold, it is placed in a large pot about a tenth filled with water. The water is the source of steam that cooks the Moin-Moin. Moin-Moin is eaten alone or with bread as a snack, with rice as a meal or with ogi for breakfast or supper. it can also be taken with garri in the afternoon.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/MoinMoin_London.jpg/375px-MoinMoin_London.jpg,,

265,Oceania(Australasia),AU,Australia,"kangaroo steak","Kangaroo meat is mostly produced in Australia from wild kangaroos and in 2010 was exported to over 55 countries worldwide. The kangaroo has been historically a staple source of protein for indigenous Australians. Kangaroo meat is high in protein and low in fat (about 2%). Kangaroo meat has a very high concentration of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) when compared with other foods. CLA has been attributed with a wide range of health benefits including anti-carcinogenic and anti-diabetes properties, in addition to reducing obesity and atherosclerosis. While kangaroo meat has enjoyed popularity for its organic nature, little information has been available about its nutrition benefits besides articles dedicated to the value of CLA's. While basic nutritional data (total protein, fats etc.) are published worldwide, little research has been provided about the nature of the kangaroo protein and its composite amino acid profile. Of the 22 amino acids within protein, ten are vital to human and animal well-being because they can't be manufactured in the body. These are called 'essential amino acids' and the primary research on kangaroo muscle meat nutrition is from a seminal research paper by the primary Australian government science organisation CSIRO in 1970.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Kangaroo_with_thyme_at_restaurant_Memphis.jpg/375px-Kangaroo_with_thyme_at_restaurant_Memphis.jpg,,

It consists of a wheat-flour-based bread, traditionally baked in the coals of a campfire or in a camp oven. Damper is an iconic Australian dish. It is also made in camping situations in New Zealand, and has been for many decades. Damper was originally developed by stockmen who travelled in remote areas for long periods, with only basic rations of flour, sugar and tea, supplemented by whatever meat was available. The basic ingredients of damper were flour, water and sometimes milk. Baking soda could be used for leavening. Damper was normally cooked in the ashes of the campfire. The ashes were flattened, and the damper was cooked there for ten minutes. Following this, it was covered with ashes and cooked for another 20 to 30 minutes until it sounded hollow when tapped. Alternatively, damper was cooked in a greased camp oven. Damper was eaten with dried or cooked meat or golden syrup.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Damper_%28food%29.jpg/330px-Damper_%28food%29.jpg,,
